## Stack

-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.13+), SQLAlchemy 2.0+, Pydantic, PostgreSQL 17
-   **Frontend**: Svelte 5, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, native fetch (zero HTTP deps)
-   **Type Safety**: OpenAPI TypeScript generator (auto-sync backend → frontend)
-   **Infra**: Docker Compose, Nginx for static builds

## Code Style

### Python

-   Python 3.13+ features, type hints everywhere
-   SQLAlchemy 2.0+ `Mapped` annotations
-   Pydantic v2.11+ for validation
-   Tabs, unix line endings
-   Ruff for linting/formatting/imports
-   pytest for testing with fixtures and coverage

> **Reminder** - CLEAN code means:
>
> -   NO type ignore comments. If you NEED to use it, you are probably typing something wrong.
> -   NO over use of comments everywhere. Comments are good, but only to explain key, complex or crucial blocks.

### TypeScript/Svelte

-   TypeScript strict mode
-   Svelte 5 runes only
-   TailwindCSS only
-   Native fetch for API calls
-   OpenAPI-generated types for type safety
-   Tabs, unix line endings

## Patterns

-   Backend: Model → Schema → Endpoint → Test
-   SDK separation: `api/` imports from `project_name/`, not vice versa
-   URL paths: `/v1/users`
-   Frontend: Native fetch → Typed API functions → Component
-   Type safety: OpenAPI schema → generated types → compile-time checks
-   REST conventions, proper HTTP codes
-   Validate inputs (Pydantic)
-   Type everything
-   Three-tier testing: API tests, SDK tests, E2E tests
-   API changes: Update backend → run `npm run generate:api-types` → types sync

## AI Agent Behavior

### General Guidelines

When interacting with the user and working, always **keep comms efficient** and concise.

As an AI, your context is limited, thus overly verbose responses will directly affect how your performance degrades over time.
**Less is more** - focus on addressing the user's needs never create extra files or documentation to report changes unless explicitly asked.

### Running Code

When the user asks you to run code, always:

-   **For backend code**: Always remember to cd into `backend/`. Always enable the virtual environment.
-   **For frontend code**: Always remember to cd into `frontend/`.
-   Check the current working directory if unsure where you are.
-   Check terminal output if unsure whether the venv is activated.

## Extended Instructions

Additional domain-specific `.instructions.md` files can be created in the `.github/instructions/` directory. These files use YAML frontmatter with `applyTo` patterns to automatically apply when editing specific file types. The user can also manually attach them via Chat → Add Context → Instructions.
See readme in the `.github/instructions/` directory for more details.
